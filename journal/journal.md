*Microbit: A Password to open a door*

This project is related to mine because it uses the microbit as a keypad for the code to get into the box, I really wanted to include a code on my box and explored this quite a lot but just couldn't work out how to get the music, lights and code all to work together without purchasing multiple extra parts this was also the focus of my Design Concept 2. If I get time later in the production of the project and can work out how to incorporate this as well, I definitely will.

*Micro:bit Surprise box*

This project is related to mine because it is using the microbit to create an element of surprise in the project, which is what I am hoping to achieve with my project. I was tempted to do something like this which also is related to the first project above but the code etc.. and the different sensors that I would need, meant trying to find a cheaper way around needing to purchase the micro:bit accessories. This would mean perhaps learning a bit about Arduino which seems a little cheaper and more accessible locally for me. I am not sure I am ready to learn this side of things yet but definitely see the potential in this as time goes on.  I'm sure this could be made cheaper though and without the extension parts and will keep it in mind for if my project is a complete failure, which I'm sure it won't.*.

*Micro:bit Music Box*

This project is related to mine because it is in a box and plays music, it is a much more simplified version of what I am trying to achieve but is where I will start with the code for the box.

### Related project 5 ###
*Microbit: Chocolate vending machine*

![Image](https://github.com/LeanneCochrane1701QCA/Leanne-Cochrane1701QCA-Assignment-2-/blob/master/Chocolate%20vending%20machine.jpg)

This project is related to mine because it is using some mechanical parts, the micro:bit and the servo motor. I will definitely be needing some mechanical parts and it is good to see how other people manage these.  The microbit will be a big part of my project and as I am toying with the idea of using a servo motor, it is helpful to see it in action.

### Related project 6 ###
*Microbit: My robot asks me for money*

This project is related to mine because again it is quite mechanical. I love the way he uses foil and wire to manage his project, makes use of the servo motor and microbit in a different way.

## Other research ##
<!--- Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it. You should include a reference or link to each of these resources. --->

## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
<!--- Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence. --->

### Design ideation ###
<!--- Document your ideation process. This will include the design concepts presented for assessment 2. You can copy and paste that information here. --->

### Final design concept ###
<!--- This should be a description of your concept including its context, motivation, or other relevant information you used to decide on this concept. --->

### Interaction flowchart ###
<!--- Include an interaction flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible. --->

## Process documentation ##
<!--- In this section, include text and images (and potentially links to video) that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.

This should have quite a lot of information! It will likely include most of the process documentation from assessment 2 which can be copied and pasted here.

Use subheadings to structure this information. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for details of how to insert subheadings.

There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. --->

## Final code ##

<!--- Include here screenshots of the final code you used in the project if it is done with block coding. If you have used javascript, micropython, C, or other code, include it as text formatted as code using a series of three backticks ` before and after the code block. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for more information about that formatting. --->

## Design process discussion ##
<!--- Discuss your process used in this project, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process. --->


## Reflection ##

<!--- Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.

What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?

What parts of your project do you feel are novel? This is IMPORTANT to help justify a key component of the assessment rubric.

What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used? --->
